In computer programs, one of the most familiar sets of operators, the Boolean operators, is used to work with true/false values. Boolean operators include AND, OR, NOT (or AND NOT), and NEAR. These (and variations such as XOR) are used in logic gate s. You may have used Boolean operators in a search engine , by entering a phrase such as Galileo AND satellite (some search engines require the operator be capitalized) to find information. Among the other types of operators used in computer programming are: assignment operators , which assign a specified value to another value and relational operators , which compare two values.");

Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities. Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. For example, 0/0 is undefined as a real number, and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is imaginary, and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.");
